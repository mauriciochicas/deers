Hello World!
 
This is our little contribution to you, programmers around the world.

We are two young boys that don´t like so much use frameworks for our projects because we are very weirdos. So, we built our own framework from us to us and you.

It´s a really basic framework, it focus on AJAX and MVC model, we wrote it in PHP.

We really hope that it will helpful for you.

Thank you for reading.
